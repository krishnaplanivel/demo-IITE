🧠 1. What is Git?

Git is a version control system — a tool that helps you track changes in your code.

Think of it like a “time machine” for your project:

You can save different versions (called commits).

You can go back to an earlier version anytime.

You can work on new features safely using branches.

You can merge everyone’s work together.

📍Example:
You’re building a website.

First version: home page only → Commit 1

Second version: add login → Commit 2

Third version: fix bugs → Commit 3
You can always go back to any version easily.
🌐 2. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform that stores your Git repositories online.

So Git is the tool → GitHub is the website where you keep and share your projects.

📍Example:
You have your code on your laptop (local repo).
You upload it to GitHub (remote repo).
Now you can:

Access it from anywhere

Collaborate with others

Show your work to employers
